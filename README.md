# Modifications

Some customization I have made to this theme, to add even more aesthetics.

- Change Latin font into `Charter`
- Change Asian font into `Songti SC` (make sure you have installed the font if you are using Windows)
- Optimized math blocks in PDF outputs

# Vintage Theme for Typora

`Vintage` is a typora theme and featured with following aspects:

- A simple and powerful three-line `table` and a beautiful, easy-to-read `task list`.
- A concise interface with appropriate distances between objects.
- A variety of different headings with totally 6 levels: H3 is marked in brown to distinguish it from other headers. Every `header`/`ToC item`/`outline item` is automatically enquiped with a section number to indicate the position.
- Dark mode.

> This theme had been tested under `Windows` System.
